                    <p>Every day we face technologies that no one could even dream of 30-40 years ago.</p>
                    <p>It is very difficult to imagine what awaits us next, just as 30 years ago people could not imagine what would be waiting for them today.</p>

                    <p>Today, people can make neural networks that will create great images THEMSELVES.</p>
                    <p>On the right you can see examples of such images - they were generated by a neural network.</p>
                    <p>They are very close to reality. Of course, they are not very detailed, but this is a neural network and it is just learning.</p>

                        <p>Nowadays, people make robots that help them in their daily work. But sooner or later everyone thinks that robots can replace humans in some aspects of our lives.</p>
                        <p>For example, delivery robots can deliver food by the type of pizza and products from the store. These already exist in some countries.</p>
                        <p>But in China and some other places, people are already developing humanoid robots and have already achieved very good success in this field. Who knows what awaits us next...</p>
